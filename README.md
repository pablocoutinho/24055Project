Objective
  
  The "Memo Sphere" project represents the creation of an online shopping application with the aim of showing and applying into practice the knowledge acquired throughout the semester of the Mobile App subject.

The idea of developing the application comes from creating a platform that contains the most simplified and polished design possible so that it is easy and light to navigate and can be used by all types of users, ranging from the most experienced to the most layman in technology. Colours based on purple and intuitive scrolling list navigation when on the page of products available for sale in the app. Each product has its own page with unique information about it.

1.	Layouts and Pages

 1.1 Authentication Page

Before going to the first page the application initializes with a quick presentation showing the app logo and a small delay of 2 seconds to move to the next page. The authentication page is officially the first page where the user can interact with it, being a crucial component to guarantee access to the application, guaranteeing security and collecting some user data. To begin with, the authentication process is made simple, allowing the user to log in if they have already registered on the application previously or also a clickable text so that new users are directed to another screen where they can create their accounts using a username and password, as well as some other data that is requested. After registering, users can log in with their email and password, giving quick access to the rest of the application by going to the main interface. For the security of user data and the application itself, when connected, the system stores the user ID locally on the device. This allows the application to keep the user logged in automatically, even after the device restarts, eliminating the need to log in after each use. This functionality not only improves the user experience, but also strengthens security by ensuring that access is kept private and accessible only through the user's device.

1.2	Items List
The application's main page takes the user to view the products available for purchase on the "Memo Sphere" and is designed in the form of a list to offer practical and accessible navigation for a simplified shopping experience. The initial interface presents a list of product categories containing some basic information such as photo, product name, price and even the category that product is classified in, making it easier for users to find the type of item they want and can send them directly to the cart with just one touch of the purchase button. Each product listed can also be selected for more details by clicking on the product photo and taking the user to a dedicated page that shows its full description including price information, a more detailed image of the product, as well as the option of being able to select more than one piece from the product. same product, which can be adjusted to the desired quantity to be sent to the card. This organization not only makes the purchasing process more direct and informed, but also significantly improves the interactivity and usability of the application. The list is displayed in a top arrangement.

1.3	Cart
The cart page in the "Memo Sphere" application was created with the aim of giving the user the clearest and most effective view possible of previously selected items where they can edit, removing items that were abandoned or even selected unintentionally. The page has a summary of the products that have been added to the cart, allowing users to review their choices before finalizing the purchase. Each item is displayed in a scrollable list using a top layout arrangement that includes some product information such as name, image and price, as well as buttons to add or remove the quantity of the same item that the user wants to buy, which makes the application easier to use. At the bottom of the screen, the user can view the total value of the items as well as the total quantity of items that were selected for better transparency of what is being purchased before making the purchase. With a simple tap on the "checkout" button, users can move to a new screen to collect data for the purchase, such as card details, telephone number and delivery address, which will be stored securely.


1.4	Orders

The third main page of the Memo Sphere App is orders. This in turn aims to be a place where the user will have control and more information about their orders, containing some information about all purchases made and completed by the user, organized in the form of a list. For each order, a unique ID is automatically generated for identification. The list is organized and grouped by purchases. If, for example, the user places an order for 4 products in a single purchase, a purchase will be shown with the 4 products grouped together in a single order. Each order already contains product information, such as name, price, category and image, without the need to open a new window with the same information. When a user selects a specific order, they are directed to a details page that provides complete information about that order.

1.5	Users page
This is the last page that can be accessed from the bottom bar of the application where the user will find their own information and data, such as photo, name, telephone, email and address that were previously stored when the user signed up/in on the page authentication. personalized and focused on offering an individualized experience. Furthermore, above the information the user can add a photo to their profile. The logout button is located just below the information in a centralized and well-marked manner. Upon clicking this button, the user is immediately logged out, with all session information being removed from the device, ensuring that login is not automatically reset after logging out. A little above the logout button, the user can also find a small text clicked "about us" where they will be directed to a new screen with information about the application's credits. There is also a map tool at the end of the page with the user's real-time geolocation as an extra tool.
